Effective local government, which is able to provide local infrastructure and services, is key to inclusive development at the last mile, and enabling local governments to collect resources and deliver services in an efficient & transparent manner enhances their capacity to deliver the conditions for well-being, sustainability, and innovation. Our work also aligns with Target 9.c, leveraging local intermediaries to provide digitally-enabled access to services to populations that may otherwise have to rely on physical channels, or have difficulty accessing services at all.",

SDG 17 - To make cities work for citizens requires collaborative efforts that reach across every sector of economy and society. We place great emphasis on collaboration and co-creation because urban governance is an inherently complex problem. We think of the ecosystem in terms of three sectors: samaaj (society), sarkaar (government), and bazaar (market or industry). The ecosystem first approach is what differentiates eGov from organisations that seek to identify “what works” and then scale that solution. We aim to create networks of trust and partnership that enhance local capacity to solve - so that the diverse challenges of urban India can be met by a wide range of local solutions, each effective in its own context.",
