If deployed in a public server (currently the main deployment is still within the University of Waikato server but it will be moved to Cloud), a prospective user can register for an account and once approved, retrieve data through the API. The API uses an injection proof filtered SQL query to bring back results from the database.  You are also able to currently retrieve all occurrence-based data held in the database in one go."
