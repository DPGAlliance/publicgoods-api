  "description": "SantéMPI is a proven, next-generation, fully featured Master Patient Index/Client Registry (MPI/CR) platform designed to overcome barriers to leveraging person-centered data as a catalyst for transforming health systems. It is an essential national digital health infrastructure component that leverages unique identity to facilitate data consolidation, harmonization, sharing, and building health information exchanges (e.g., OpenHIE) to establish interoperability across multiple software solutions. It’s flexible architecture and online/offline capability also supports large scale registration programs such as COVID-19 vaccination registration, and birth and death updates to a CRVS. SantéMPI fulfills these essential roles by implementing all relevant interoperability specifications and requirements related to Client Registry in the OpenHIE specification, including Client Registry as a service, HL7 FHIR, and widely deployed legacy standards like HL7v2. SantéMPI is a PATH Digital Square MPI “global good”, that helps create and liberate the power of high-fidelity data to maximize return on investment for both existing and future digital health solutions.",

SanteSuite uses a variety of best practices and processes depending on client needs and capacity to participate. For complex projects we follow a Disciplined Agile Delivery Approach which combines the rigor of traditional processes, such as Waterfall and Unified Processes, with the responsiveness of Agile. At a minimum, we leverage Kanban and Scrum (Scrumban) for delivery of smaller projects where our clients do not have the capacity to participate in a full agile delivery. We implement a quality assurance plan after each iteration ensuring that all modules and features work as they are expected. We follow the test-driven development methodology, which ensure that all components or modules are thoroughly tested before they are incorporated into the final solution. Accompanying documentation is provided with each release, including technical documentation and release notes / change logs."
