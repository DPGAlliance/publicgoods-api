      "evidenceText": "Most of Treejer's users in the tree plantation side are among vulnerable communities in developing countries in LatAm, Africa and Middle East. By onboarding them, we provide them with a new channel of income. Some of them were unemployed before working with us. Also, our Rural Development Fund, supports local communities in areas other than environmental work. We aim to distribute micr0-loans and micro-grants from this fund to eligible planters working with Treejer. Microfinance and land ownership are key ways to eliminate poverty.",

      "SDGNumber": 5,
      "evidenceText": "We're building technologies that promote the empowerment of women. This is mainly done by providing fair and equal access to remote job opportunities in places where women have less opportunities. We encourage rural ambassadors to invite more women as planters in their local communities.",

      "SDGNumber": 6,
      "evidenceText": "By reducing stormwater runoff and soil erosion, trees and plants can aid communities with water quality issues. Trees help collect nutrients that might otherwise be washed away from the soil. Some of our communities plant the trees in strategic places for better management of rain water. Forests slow the flow of water by intercepting precipitation and by consuming water in the ground.",

      "SDGNumber": 8,
      "evidenceText": "One of the most important features of Treejer protocol is providing bankless payments to unbanked individuals as they contribute to the environmental causes. We have a special focus on onboarding communities from global south and provide them with decent job opportunities as planters. All women and men receive equal pay for work of equal value. In addition, we work with contributors from various countries. Currently, most of our core contributors are immigrants.",

Treejer's innovations has already added financial, technological and technical support to African, LatAm and Middle Eastern people.",

When working with local communities in the supply side, we do our best to minimize the cost for them. For instance, Treejer sponsors blockchain transaction fees for rural planters and charges planters $0 costs to use Treejer. We consider costless and incentivized inclusion as a key design principle in product development.",

Their forestation efforts provides safe and inclusive access to green and public spaces. Also, forests facilitate mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and resilience to disasters specially by flood prevention.",

We need to make the necessary changes to protect the earth via education, open innovation, and adherence to our climate obligations. Governments lack enough coordination tools, but web3 is providing unprecedented opportunities with new incentive structures globally. As a web3-native and open-source project, we're experimenting for a faster and multi-stakeholder climate innovation.",
