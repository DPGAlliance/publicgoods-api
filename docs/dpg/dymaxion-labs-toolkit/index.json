The problem has been traditionally addressed as a quantity deficit, but it has become a quality deficit: wide swaths of the population lack access to public services, housing tenure and other qualitative aspects. Our tool identifies and monitors location and growth patterns of informal settlements through satellite or aerial images. It can help predict the location and number of residents without access to basic services, and produce extremely-high resolution maps to guide precise targeting of amelioration efforts.",
