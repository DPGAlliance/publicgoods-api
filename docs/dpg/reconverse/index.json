The following measures have been put in place to avoid such situations: \n- the main/master branches are kept functional at all time and protected \n- new code contributions are made via pull requests (PR) \n- code reviews are required for new code contributions to be acceptedÂ \n- continuous integration is used to ensure that new contributions pass all installation checks and unit tests on multiple platforms, and that the documentation is adequate \n- continuous integration is used to ensure that PRs do not decrease test coverage\n - we aim for complete (near 100%) test coverage for all our packages"
