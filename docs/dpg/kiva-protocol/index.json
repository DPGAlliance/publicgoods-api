      "evidenceText": "From our experience lending with partners across 94 countries, we know verifiable identity is an atomic unit for scaling access to the formal financial sector. This poses distinct challenges for women gaining greater financial access. Women are less likely to have ID documents and often face cultural constraints in how they use them.  Kiva Protocol offers an alternative approach to digital identity management that can provide real benefits to women.  An open-source authentication platform, Kiva Protocol enables individuals to store a version of their identity documents in a digital wallet that they control, providing them with a highly secure and portable digital record. The individual doesn’t have to rely on a physical credential, increasing agency and privacy over how and when to share her information. "

      "As described previously, Kiva Protocol follows 'privacy by design' principles, including data minimization, non-correlation, and user control/ selective disclosure. And of course, no PII is ever written to the ledger. However, for any given implementation it remains up to our government partners to define their own governance policies and determine their compliance with all relevant laws.  Therefore all terms of service, privacy policies, etc. are defined on a project basis. \nInter-agency data sharing between the National Civil Registration Authority and the Bank of Sierra Leone is permitted under the National Civil Registration Authority Act.  Additional regulations governing the use of the eKYC platform to facilitate new account onboarding and customer due diligence are being developed by the Bank of Sierra Leone. A broader initiative to develop a consumer protection regime in Sierra Leone - which may include privacy and consumer financial protection - is being conducted by UNCDF with support from Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)."

Its design and operational model embodies best practices around privacy, agency, and open and standards-based technologies, and specifically adheres to the ID4D Principles of Identification.  Though it isn’t formally measured, the community also actively seeks to support Privacy by Design and principles of data minimization and non-correlation so that users can have confidence sharing data between issuers. The Core Infrastructure Initiative badge is a part of certifying the components of the system that are part of Hyperledger and project results can be found here https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/4088."

Holding these data in Kiva Protocol’s cloud-based digital wallet infrastructure typically provides higher levels of privacy and security than the on-prem or hybrid databases maintained by identity agencies in Kiva partner jurisdictions. Each data subject wallet is encrypted with its own key. A defense in depth approach is used throughout the architecture to ensure that no one failure can compromise the entire system. This includes, but is not limited to, a Web Application Firewall, separation of duties, regular dependency patching, and security monitoring. In addition, we run regular security audits to find and address vulnerabilities in our configuration, software and architecture. The last audit used ioActive."
