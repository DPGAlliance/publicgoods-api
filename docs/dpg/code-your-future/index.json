      "evidenceText": "Code Your Future is a free code school for refugees and other people excluded from education. All our classes are free and our teachers are volunteers. Our free and open source syllabus is developed and published directly on Github. We collaborate with other free code schools, both within the MigraCode network (https://migracode.eu/) and ad-hoc in the UK, South Africa, Gaza, Roma, Medellin, etc. \nWe are committed to free and open source education and curriculum development and all our materials are published and shared freely.  We do our work in public. As well as our in-person classes, people can, and do, use our syllabus by themselves, or in a code group, or within another code school. For example, MigraCode Barcelona are doing our React module right now! :) That being said, I have included some metrics and data from our in-person Software Development Course. \nOur work largely falls on these targets in SDG 4: \n- Target 4.3: Equal access to affordable technical, vocational and higher education \n- Target 4.4: Increase the number of people with relevant skills for financial success \n- Target 4.5: Eliminate all discrimination in education"

We are all, volunteers, staff, and trainees, bound by our Code of Conduct https://codeyourfuture.io/about/code-of-conduct/  \n2. We have a named Safeguarding lead. Staff We now also require buddies to undergo Safeguarding training. All volunteers must sign our volunteer agreement before accessing our Slack workspace. As a registered charity in the UK we are regulated by the Charity Commission and our governance is here https://codeyourfuture.io/governance/ \n3. We also contract a learning coach to work 1:1 with trainees with significant challenges, which as we are all engineers are mainly autism and ADHD."
