  "description": "Sunbird Lern is primarily a set of microservices along with some reference UX widgets that offer capabilities to enable tracking of a user’s learning journey as well as enable interactions and collaboration among users. These capabilities can be leveraged by any adopter with requirements for measurement of learning progress, creation and management of cohorts/ batches of learners, as well as enabling collaboration capabilities such as Groups or Discussion forums. The Lern services are also employed for creation and management of user accounts and organisations within a Sunbird instance.",

These included healthcare workers and professionals as well as volunteers - this was launched on the Integrated Government Online training portal, and resulted in Sunbird Lern being successfully leveraged for training several thousands of frontline workers in the fight against Covid. This was one of the measures undertaken by the National Health Mission and was also part of the operational guidelines from the Ministry of Health. This effort is in line with goal #3.d of the global framework. ",

No one can add a user to a group without their consent. Users can exit discussion areas at any time. Minors need to provide parental consent for authorisation flows.
