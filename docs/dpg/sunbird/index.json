Sunbird-Ed is the out of the box reference solution that offers a portal, mobile app, and a desktop app with reference UX and workflows. \nThrough these building blocks Sunbird enables access to learning opportunities to anyone, anytime, anywhere. Sunbird is designed for massive scale to meet diverse learning needs of a country as populated as India. Sunbird microservices enable various functionalities such as contribution, curation, and publishing of content; progress tracking; credentialing; tagging to rich taxonomy; data analytics and exhaust; user & org management; and more. Sunbird also handles multiple languages not only for user interface, but also for content/assets that are created within the software. \nSunbird has been adopted by the Ministry of Education, Government of India to launch a national school education platform called DIKSHA. DIKSHA has been used extensively in each of the 36 States and Union Territories in India across 30+ languages. Through DIKSHA (which is built completely on Sunbird), millions of students, teachers, parents, educational leaders, and community in India  are accessing learning opportunities. During Covid-19 it has proven to be an instrumental large scale platform for maintaining learning continuity. Sunbird (in full or partial) is also adopted by few other Government and private sector projects. \nSunbird can be used by various adopters for school education, teacher development, school administration and school leadership development, upskilling mid-career professionals, financial literacy, technical training, and other areas related to learning and overall human development in order to improve prospects of earning a livelihood, improving economic conditions, and lifestyle of a large population. Sunbird with its building block approach enables adopters to roll-out open platforms as public infrastructure and enable the ecosystem to innovate leveraging the building blocks.",

Implementers/adopters of Sunbird, have the autonomy to decide “what” fields to be capture/maintain, “what” other systems will they integrate with, “will” they share this data with other authorized parties (e.g. one Government sharing this dataset with other Government, or one Department sharing this dataset with other Department). While the Sunbird technical architecture has taken privacy and security controls into consideration as default implementation, it is up to the Implementers/Adopters to establish a privacy policy at their end to cover the various implementation scenarios (e.g. management & sharing of PII/non PII data)."
