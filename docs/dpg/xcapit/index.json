This is why we are leveraging technology to increase the access to education equally for both women and men, in an engaging and gamified way with topics like personal finances and blockchain. We are working on universal design to ensure everyone can use our platform, including people with disabilities. The donation modules enable people to contribute to causes related to financing educational and grants programs. This is how we contribute to SDG 4 at Xcapit.",

By enhancing the use of  technology and by providing financial and blockchain education we promote women’s empowerment and improve the participation and equal opportunities in topics related to finance and blockchain. The ability to financially plan, learn and invest without intermediaries helps women to take ownership and control of their own money and, therefore, their freedom. This is how we contribute to SDG 5 at Xcapit.",

    {
      "SDGNumber": 10,
      "evidenceText": "We increase financial accessibility and inclusion to reduce inequality and ensure no one is left behind, especially in developing countries and vulnerable populations. Our first target is Latin America, in which a large population is unbanked and where remittances have become slow, expensive and sometimes at the risk of scam for those unbanked. Our solution allows sending remittances in less than 10 minutes and paying less than 20 cents of American dollar per transaction. Some countries have high inflation and devaluation, deeply affecting the low-income bracket population, accentuating the vicious intergenerational cycle of poverty. Our mobile app allows them to save in stronger currencies and invest their capital. The gamified education of personal finances is aimed to help parents have a healthier relationship with money, improving and teaching a new culture of saving and investing for their children and future generations. The user is completely anonymous and can have the control of her or his own money regardless of gender, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic or any other status. This is how  we contribute to SDG 10 at Xcapit.",
