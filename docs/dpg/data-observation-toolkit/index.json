When it comes to health, better data can be a matter of life and death.”  DataKind developed the Data Observation Toolkit (DOT) in response to a gap in digital health solutions space to monitor health data generated by other digital tools for problems with data integrity, quality and other scenarios that might need attention. The toolkit aims to provide easier access to data monitoring without the need for deep technical skills. ",
