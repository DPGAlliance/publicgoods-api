      "We refer to https://digitalprinciples.org/. The service was not developed with these directly in mind, but our process still fit well with many of these principles (which is reassuring both for the principles and Met Norway Weather):",
      "I. Design with the user.\n We strive for user-producer (co-production): Close collaboration with relevant users and stakeholders of forecast when building the new version of our service. Iterate after feedback from those users.",
      "II. Understand the existing ecosystem. \n We strive for continuous learning and understanding of the general technological landscape, and have more specific discussions with institutions with similar types of services.",
      "III. Design for scale. \n This is very important to us. To this end, the service is built to scale horizontally in a kubernetes environment.",
      "IV. Build of sustainability. \n Met Norway has a long-term perspective for planning, funding and supporting our core services. Met Norway Weather is part of our core services and funding. If there should be a massive increase in the number of requests that goes beyond what can be regarded as the current core service, we will explore opportunities to tackle this positive challenge.",
      "V. Be data driven. \n The weather forecast quality is continuously improved through forecast verification where the weather forecast data are compared to observations, monitoring by meteorologists and through feedback from our users. The latter also includes understanding the forecasts for decision-making. A weather forecast is not complete before it is understood and used.",
      "VI. Use open standards, open data, open source and open innovation. \n Met Norway has an open data policy, and the associated data services are also free of charge with the possibility to select a dedicated service at cost recovery basis. Met Norway Weather is built employing open standards, e.g http, geojson, openapi.",
      "VII. Reuse and improve. \n The service reuses large amounts of existing data produced by regional and global numerical weather prediction models in order for Met Norway to fulfill its core mission to protect life and property and support business. Largely driven by Met Norway Weather and Yr, the raw model forecast data are post-processed (e.g. introducing citizen observations) correcting for systematic errors and introducing advanced localization of the forecast details for improved user experience and decision-making. The service reuses existing infrastructure and processing pipelines.",
      "VIII. Address privacy & security. \n We minimize the collection of personal data (see 9a below). In part by avoiding it all together, making the service available without registration of users. We keep traffic logs for operational concerns, but minimize access to those logs to only relevant personnel, and keep the logs in local infrastructure within national borders.",
      "IX. Be collaborative. \n - Building the service is continuously done through a close collaboration between IT personnel and geoscience researchers (meteorological and computational co-design). \n - The interface to the service was created in close collaboration with important users of our service."
