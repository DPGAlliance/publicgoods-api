For instance, the law mandates a 5% reservation for the disabled in India, but educational institutions are often at a loss in delivering inclusive education services, forcing students to rely on volunteers and often dropping out. Similarly, reasonable accommodations are still in their infancy at corporates throughout the country. Specifically, for people with print disabilities, this leads to much of the content (e.g. textbooks, handouts etc.) as well as over 97.4% of webpages remaining inaccessible due to it being incompatible with assistive technologies. Covid-19 has further exacerbated this challenge with social distancing leading to lack of volunteers and online education leading to a proliferation in the creation and sharing of inaccessible digital content. Thus, I-Stem, through our work in document accessibility seeks to end this \"book famine\", thereby promoting independence and self-reliance in education for all.",

This project is the first step in this direction in being able to provide organizations and people with disabilities the tools they need to convert any inaccessible content into accessible format (including complex content such as math, multi-column layouts, tables etc.). This not only helps people with disabilities access content in a reliable and efficient manner but also substantially saves time, effort and money (by upto 70%) spent by organizations to remediate content. This enhances access to information on an equal basis, leading to the community being able to contribute to the economy more meaningfully.",

The platform targets to provide equal accessibility for all people, with special focus on the vulnerable population- people with disabilities, people in geographically vulnerable areas, minor ethnic groups. In addition to facilitating equal accessibility to skills development for all, the platform incorporates academia supported career counseling, AI based career guidance, educational skills in blended mode to further ensure quality education.

This platform is designed to mitigate the challenges of skills mismatch that ultimately contributes to reducing unemployment problem and increases the efficiency of the labor market. To increase employability for the youth, NISE offers them accessibility to career counselling and guidance, job forecast, apprenticeship opportunities, business and entrepreneurship guidance, migration suggestions, etc. The platform’s real-time data enables the public and private skills service providers to analyze and identify the skills in demand and forecast future jobs so that they can plan their activities accordingly. To further reduce this supply-demand gap, the platform facilitates the industries to advertise job vacancies to specific audience, receive skilled youth, and maintain a supply-demand relationship with skills providers to simplify information sharing amongst them on emerging job opportunities, skilled HR, and market driven skills. Thus, NISE is essentially making impacts in economic development by preparing a demand driven skilled workforce. Youths equipped with proper skills will ultimately be able to secure decent and gainful employment not only in own country but also in abroad by ensuring skilled and safe migration and get equal pay as per their skillsets."

NISE has already been replicated in Somalia and Jordan to solve similar problem in these countries. The platform has received a number of global recognition and a few countries have shown interest to replicate it in their countries. NISE, if becomes an open-source platform, can contribute in achieving SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals) as it may be replicated in other least-developed and developing countries in south-south and triangular cooperation to enhance their capacity to achieve previously mentioned SDGs by providing skills development, employment and entrepreneurship support."

Designed to require no upfront financial investment, a fast learning curve and little time commitment to operate, it is fit for use by communities of developers, modellers, academics up to policy makers.",

This includes the ability to capture granular events via telemetry, create measures, and observe various events/actions carried out by the system/users/devices (like IoT devices) on any platform/solution. Sunbird Obsrv can be utilized as an independent building block by adopters or as part of a system that employs other Sunbird building blocks. Sunbird Obsrv comes with a set of microservices, APIs, and some utility SDKs to make it easy for adopters to rapidly enable powerful data processing and aggregation infrastructure to process telemetry data, validate telemetry stream data, as well as aggregate and generate actionable insights via APIs. It also has built-in open data cataloging and publishing capability. It is built keeping extensibility in mind so that adopters have the flexibility to adapt the telemetry and tools to their specific use-cases.",
