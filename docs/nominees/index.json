For instance, the law mandates a 5% reservation for the disabled in India, but educational institutions are often at a loss in delivering inclusive education services, forcing students to rely on volunteers and often dropping out. Similarly, reasonable accommodations are still in their infancy at corporates throughout the country. Specifically, for people with print disabilities, this leads to much of the content (e.g. textbooks, handouts etc.) as well as over 97.4% of webpages remaining inaccessible due to it being incompatible with assistive technologies. Covid-19 has further exacerbated this challenge with social distancing leading to lack of volunteers and online education leading to a proliferation in the creation and sharing of inaccessible digital content. Thus, I-Stem, through our work in document accessibility seeks to end this \"book famine\", thereby promoting independence and self-reliance in education for all.",

This project is the first step in this direction in being able to provide organizations and people with disabilities the tools they need to convert any inaccessible content into accessible format (including complex content such as math, multi-column layouts, tables etc.). This not only helps people with disabilities access content in a reliable and efficient manner but also substantially saves time, effort and money (by upto 70%) spent by organizations to remediate content. This enhances access to information on an equal basis, leading to the community being able to contribute to the economy more meaningfully.",

Originally, KSO was designed for presenting the biological diversity on the seabed of Kosterhavets National Park on the Swedish West coast - an environment that is otherwise invisible to the public. Here you can find dead whales, flying feather stars, swimming scallops, large colourful sponges and starfish.

This platform is designed to mitigate the challenges of skills mismatch that ultimately contributes to reducing unemployment problem and increases the efficiency of the labor market. To increase employability for the youth, NISE offers them accessibility to career counselling and guidance, job forecast, apprenticeship opportunities, business and entrepreneurship guidance, migration suggestions, etc. The platform’s real-time data enables the public and private skills service providers to analyze and identify the skills in demand and forecast future jobs so that they can plan their activities accordingly. To further reduce this supply-demand gap, the platform facilitates the industries to advertise job vacancies to specific audience, receive skilled youth, and maintain a supply-demand relationship with skills providers to simplify information sharing amongst them on emerging job opportunities, skilled HR, and market driven skills. Thus, NISE is essentially making impacts in economic development by preparing a demand driven skilled workforce. Youths equipped with proper skills will ultimately be able to secure decent and gainful employment not only in own country but also in abroad by ensuring skilled and safe migration and get equal pay as per their skillsets."

NISE has already been replicated in Somalia and Jordan to solve similar problem in these countries. The platform has received a number of global recognition and a few countries have shown interest to replicate it in their countries. NISE, if becomes an open-source platform, can contribute in achieving SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals) as it may be replicated in other least-developed and developing countries in south-south and triangular cooperation to enhance their capacity to achieve previously mentioned SDGs by providing skills development, employment and entrepreneurship support."

Privacy and anonymity technologies like Tor make it possible for people in countries where governments censor the internet to bypass that censorship and freely access public information. Our work supports the human right to access information, which is fundamental to effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. Some examples of Tor’s importance are included below: (1) In a report on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression (A/HRC/29/32) to the UN Human Rights Council, Special Rapporteur David Kaye wrote that Tor, alongside encryption, maybe the only way for some individuals to exercise their “freedom to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas.” Kaye also writes: “Some states impose content-based, often discriminatory restrictions or criminalize online expression, intimidating political opposition and dissenters and applying defamation and lese-majesty laws to silence journalists, defenders and activists. A VPN connection, or use of Tor or a proxy server, combined with encryption, may be the only way in which an individual is able to access or share information in such environments.” (2) Tor is widely used in Russia to access international news as the Kremlin rapidly increases internet censorship (Washington Post link included below), (3) Tor is recommended to journalists who need to protect themselves against surveillance to do their work (Freedom of the Press Foundation)    ",

Developed by the Urban-Rural Systems (URS) team at Future Cities Laboratory (FCL), ur-scape is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).
