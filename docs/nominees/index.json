For instance, the law mandates a 5% reservation for the disabled in India, but educational institutions are often at a loss in delivering inclusive education services, forcing students to rely on volunteers and often dropping out. Similarly, reasonable accommodations are still in their infancy at corporates throughout the country. Specifically, for people with print disabilities, this leads to much of the content (e.g. textbooks, handouts etc.) as well as over 97.4% of webpages remaining inaccessible due to it being incompatible with assistive technologies. Covid-19 has further exacerbated this challenge with social distancing leading to lack of volunteers and online education leading to a proliferation in the creation and sharing of inaccessible digital content. Thus, I-Stem, through our work in document accessibility seeks to end this \"book famine\", thereby promoting independence and self-reliance in education for all.",

This project is the first step in this direction in being able to provide organizations and people with disabilities the tools they need to convert any inaccessible content into accessible format (including complex content such as math, multi-column layouts, tables etc.). This not only helps people with disabilities access content in a reliable and efficient manner but also substantially saves time, effort and money (by upto 70%) spent by organizations to remediate content. This enhances access to information on an equal basis, leading to the community being able to contribute to the economy more meaningfully.",

Each one has its own requirements, defines its own conditions and pursues its own goals. Burkina Faso must cope with all of the related demands. As a result, its ministries host over 300 different project teams. Acting on the initiative of the donors, these teams sometimes work at cross purposes in the same regions and sectors. TruBudget allows for the establishment of shared platforms that significantly expand donors' scope for using a partner country's systems. If funds are no longer channeled past the partner country's government structures but out of government structures in the partner country, this strengthens the partner country's capacities and its ownership. Donor contributions from different donors can be used in a coordinated manner in line with the respective national development policy priorities. This can drastically reduce the major coordination and administrative workload for the partner countries.

It helps develop liveable neighbourhoods, build responsive towns, reduce city ‘stress points’ (flooding, traffic snarls, poverty) and enhance ‘sweet spots’ (accessible, equitable, economically vibrant), and progress towards strategic development goals (regional, national and SDGs).  Developed by the Urban-Rural Systems (URS) team at Future Cities Laboratory (FCL), ur-scape is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Swiss Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Pilot implementation of the ur-scape tool is supported by the municipal planning authorities of the city of Bandung, the Indonesian Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning (MASP), and the Bauhaus Weimar University.",
