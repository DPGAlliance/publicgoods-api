With manual reporting, release of dengue data is delayed which hampers the health sector’s ability to effectively deal with the threat. There was a need to move the emphasis from treatment to prevention. Project AEDES was then developed to improve public health response and address the challenge of getting real-time on the ground information on dengue.
