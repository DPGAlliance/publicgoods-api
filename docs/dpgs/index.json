When monitoring a public facility, the owner of the facility is present, and the project team immediately notifies him or her of which elements of the facility do not meet the standards for accessibility of facilities open to the public. On the portal “Accessible Kazakhstan” one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the “Accessible Kazakhstan” project that a unique online course “Ensuring accessibility of a public facility” was developed. The course: helps to get acquainted with legislation governing the provision of access to public facilities for people with disabilities and other population groups with limited mobility; can be used to find out what criteria accessibility of public facilities and open spaces is evaluated by; explains how to protect one’s right to a barrier-free environment; teaches how to monitor a public facility and develop recommendations for its adaptation to the needs of people with disabilities.",

DiCRA platform therefore contributes to SDG 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts'. With its objective to enhance climate adaptation measures through data-driven approaches as well as impact on policies for climate resilient agriculture, DiCRA platform contributes directly to SDG target 13.1 'Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries' and SDG target 13.2 to 'Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning'.",

The ecosystem first approach is what differentiates eGov from organisations that seek to identify “what works” and then scale that solution.

Scaled through funding by the Global Fund, GAVI, USAID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Win Philanthropy, Vital Strategies, and the Pan American Health Organization, Harmony is utilized to integrate and analyze data across various sectors, including health (for national and sub-national HIV, TB, Malaria, supply chain, programs) and poverty reduction.  Harmony has been used to integrate data from multiple structured data sources, including various health management information systems (e.g. DHIS2), logistic management information systems (e.g. OpenLMIS), Excel and CSV files, surveys (e.g. Demographic and Health Surveys), scorecards, financial data, from individual level data to national surveys, and from open source and enterprise systems. Once data is integrated, it is used to optimize vaccine supply chains, improve financial and human resource allocations for health programs, mitigate loss to follow up of patients, identify and respond to data quality issues, align labor data to educational supply data, rapidly respond to global or national emergencies (e.g. hurricanes and pandemics), and coordinate inter-agency actions and funding. 1. No Poverty Evidence: Harmony is being deployed in more than 8 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and in more than 25 countries through global projects, to integrate and effectively utilize data to mitigate the health and economic challenges felt by those living in extreme poverty. Harmony supports a myriad of governments and organizations to focus on health poverty alleviation that leads to improved health outcomes, a reduction out-of-pocket payments and health expenditures and a healthier workforce. For example, through the RBM Partnership to End Malaria project, Zenysis is supporting the development coordination and mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, in order to provide adequate and predictable supply of malaria commodities and technical assistance services that impact those living in extreme poverty.  Every country Harmony is deployed in is classified as low or middle income country per the World Bank’s classification.   ",

Harmony is used by national health ministries, global health stakeholders (The Global Fund, Gavi, USAID). During the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 countries utilized their instance of Harmony for their pandemic response. Excerpt from Devex Article: “Zenysis builds relationships by starting small, and solving data and interoperability problems, identified by users,” John Fairhurst, the head of private sector engagement at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, told Devex by email. “This model has proved effective in a range of operating and digital maturity contexts.\" In addition to Mozambique, Zenysis works in Brazil, Pakistan, South Africa, Zambia, Benin, Ethiopia, and Rwanda, as well as for the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, which operates globally. Rwanda Biomedical Centre, a government organization affiliated with Rwanda’s Health Ministry, used to have separate tracking systems for different health priorities, with one for HIV/AIDS, another for malaria, another for tuberculosis, and so on. It is now partnering with Zenysis, which is working on a new agreement with the Rwandan government. RBC said Zenysis’ approach is different from those of other tech companies that have come and gone over the years. “We attribute most of those failures to a lack of ownership or long-term vision,” said Albert Tuyishime, division manager for planning, business strategy, and monitoring and evaluation at RBC. “We’ve had some partners pull out, saying: ‘Our time here has elapsed. The resources we had are now finished, so we have to step out.’” ",

Gender Equality Evidence: In all deployments, where sex or gender disaggregated data is available, Harmony collects and integrates data on gender that can then be disaggregated and analyzed to help the government unlock key insights to have an impact on the gender-specific outcomes. For example, in South Africa, Zenysis’ software was used for the integration of Adolescent Girls and Young Women programmatic data across three Global Fund stakeholders. By using Zenysis’ analytics tools, the stakeholders have enhanced capacity to track cohorts of clients through time for their respective programs and refer clients more effectively to external services. Excerpt from Global Fund Overview Publication: “In public health programming we need to be a lot smarter in the way we use data in order to make the money go further and ensure that we reach the communities we are trying to reach with the services they require at the right time. NACOSA previously used a spreadsheet to track the number of sex workers reached in South Africa and it became very difficult to accurately track the types of services received and the profiles of the sex workers that we reached. With the Zenysis data platform we are now able to look at the unique number of sex workers reached and the exact services provided. We are able to analyse the data down to a hotspot level to be able to tailor programmatic interventions to better reach the sex workers at the right times. Additionally, we have been able to merge programmatic and finance data, which has helped us look at the cost-effectiveness of the program and identify problems.” Leora Casey Key Populations Manager, Networking HIV & AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA)",

For example data on water quality can be integrated with health data, infrastructure data, and supply chain data to pinpoint an outbreak due to unclean water and optimize the delivery of health commodities to that location.  In March and April 2019, Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth made landfall in Mozambique. The National Institute of Health of Mozambique used Harmony to quickly integrate 8 separate critical emergency response systems into a single platform for analysis. By analyzing the data integrated within Harmony and optimizing key interventions, the Government and all of its partners, including the World Health Organization and Doctors Without Borders, were able to identify tainted water sources and subsequently reduce the number of new cholera cases in Sofala Province, where Cyclone Idai made landfall, from over four hundred (400) per day to zero (0). Excerpt from FT Article: Zenysis formed part of a “virtual control room”, integrating information to help decision makers understand what was happening in the worst hit areas, identify sources of water contamination and where to prioritise cholera vaccinations. It supported an “mAlert system”, which integrated health surveillance data into a single platform for analysis. The output was daily reports distilled from data issued by health facilities and accommodation centres in affected areas, disease monitoring and surveillance from laboratory testing. Machine learning applied to disparate data helps manage shortages of medical supplies Eduardo Samo Gudo, deputy director-general of Mozambique’s National Health Institute, says that such information, combined with epidemiological bulletins and detailed presentations, helped inform daily discussions and decisions.",

Kiva Protocol offers an alternative approach to digital identity management that can provide real benefits to women.  An open-source authentication platform, Kiva Protocol enables individuals to store a version of their identity documents in a digital wallet that they control, providing them with a highly secure and portable digital record.

These children require urgent feeding, treatment and care to survive. Early detection of nutritional status is essential, but current methods are either invasive, time-intensive, error-prone, and too dangerous to use during the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, there is a need for a safer, faster and more affordable method for assessing nutritional status in children especially when clinical capacity is stretched. MERON helps to quickly identify, locate and target the children most in need of nutritional assistance. With MERON’s more timely, cheaper, yet accurate, information, we can advance the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of childhood undernutrition. For severe acute malnutrition (SAM) children alone, this means reducing deaths by 55%, thereby preventing over 150,000 deaths across low- and middle-income countries."

According to the 2018 Disability & Development Report from the UN, 'persons with disabilities are at a disadvantage regarding most Sustainable Development Goals', and 'concrete action is needed to include the world's one billion persons with disabilities, as both agents and beneficiaries of development'. Barriers to inclusion and participation are exacerbated by the lack of access to affordable, relevant assistive technology. According to existing research, only one in 10 people have access to the assistive technology they need to live independent and autonomous lives. Furthermore, inclusive digital design is uncommon for online spaces and technologies, which has resulted in people with disabilities engaging less in the digital economy. Some 62% of adults with a disability say they own a desktop or laptop computer, compared with 81% of those without a disability. Digital accessibility is recognised as a key priority in several global commitments, including the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities, and the UN Disability Inclusion Strategy, with the core aim to ensure 'no one is left behind' in our increasingly digital world. Purple HATS offers a solution that significantly contributes to the improvement of digital accessibility.

Electronic registres are trusted systems that enables consented actors (who are in the registry) to enroll and avail 3rd party services built on top of it using registry APIs. Sunbird RC can be used to build various registries of people, things, entries for across domains (hospital registry, teacher registry, vehicle registry, credential registry, etc) at country scale.   Adopters can rapidly build core electronic registries through configurable schemas and workflows. Software automatically created necessary APIs, workflows, and a default UX for all key stakeholders of the registry. In addition, adopters can use Sunbird RC to implement digital credentialing based on W3C Verifiable Credential specifications.",

Currently we live in a technological age where children and adolescents live a normality that consists of the use of technological tools. They get bored easily, the way in which information is presented to them is not very motivating and school is no longer the only means of access to education. There are different tools through which they can acquire knowledge, however the minimum has a pedagogical basis. Due to the aforementioned, we must innovate in the teaching-learning process. Currently there are new teaching methodologies, with a focus on active learning and the development of skills through play. One of these methodologies is gamification. Different authors define it as a process in which game mechanisms are used to attract people, promote learning and solve problems. The purpose is to motivate the player's behavior. Elements in the game such as points, avatars or levels, increase the psychological predisposition of the player to continue in it. This makes gamification an ally of education. Currently there are game developers who use platforms like Godot, however they do not have the pedagogical knowledge to add elements that help the user to consolidate their learning. That's why Pixframe Studios is developing a plugin for the Godot Engine: a tool to help new game developers and serious game teams create new games with the goal of aiding in the development of education. As mentioned before, Latin America is still trying to develop new tools to improve their educational field, nevertheless they don't have enough knowledge nor tools to achieve it. The plugin is open source so that the community in Latin America can access new ways of creating video games with a pedagogical basis. In this way, code is created, optimized and shared. Educational material can be shared in an innovative way and finally a stock of illustrative material is generated such as button icons, backgrounds for games, fonts and unique Godot Engine assets."

Our solution allows sending remittances in less than 10 minutes and paying less than 20 cents of American dollar per transaction. Some countries have high inflation and devaluation, deeply affecting the low-income bracket population, accentuating the vicious intergenerational cycle of poverty. Our mobile app allows them to save in stronger currencies and invest their capital. The gamified education of personal finances is aimed to help parents have a healthier relationship with money, improving and teaching a new culture of saving and investing for their children and future generations.
