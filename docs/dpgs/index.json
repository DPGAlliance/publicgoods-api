When monitoring a public facility, the owner of the facility is present, and the project team immediately notifies him or her of which elements of the facility do not meet the standards for accessibility of facilities open to the public. On the portal “Accessible Kazakhstan” one can find checklists with criteria for assessing accessibility of facilities, so that, if desired, the owners can read them and afterwards be involved in monitoring independently. Upon request, the project team develops recommendations, on the basis of which owners and government agencies start working on the adaptation of particular facilities for the aforementioned categories of citizens. Based on current data on accessibility of public facilities, comprehensive policies and plans for inclusion can be adopted and implemented. This, in turn, will reduce inequalities and accelerate achievement of other Sustainable Development Goals that affect development of an inclusive society. The world community needs qualified specialists who are able to form a barrier-free environment. It is for the purpose of training such specialists in 2019 within the framework of the “Accessible Kazakhstan” project that a unique online course “Ensuring accessibility of a public facility” was developed. The course: helps to get acquainted with legislation governing the provision of access to public facilities for people with disabilities and other population groups with limited mobility; can be used to find out what criteria accessibility of public facilities and open spaces is evaluated by; explains how to protect one’s right to a barrier-free environment; teaches how to monitor a public facility and develop recommendations for its adaptation to the needs of people with disabilities.",

The artisanal and small-scale mining sector has been linked to all 17 SDGs in a recent publication \"Mapping Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining to the Sustainable Development Goals\" (https://delvedatabase.org/resources/mapping-artisanal-and-small-scale-mining-to-the-sustainable-development-goals). \nHistorically the sector has faced a persistent \"data gap\" that has obscured its contribution to global development and marginalized the sector's from the global development agenda and from policymakers. (See Delve State of the ASM Sector report 2019 https://delvedatabase.org/resources/state-of-the-artisanal-and-small-scale-mining-sector) \nThe Delve platform's key aim is to demonstrate how support for and formalization of ASM activities can help fulfill the SDGs. By providing an accessible online platform for data collection and knowledge sharing and encouraging collaboration and contributions from the network of practitioners, Delve aims to provide a framework and impetus necessary for monitoring progress and to help ensure that the sector is recognized for its contributions to the SDGs. The platform has over 300 users, 700+ resources, 24 country dashboards showcasing ASM data, knowledge products and networks (https://delvedatabase.org/data, https://delvedatabase.org/resources, https://delvedatabase.org/people). The platform also has developed and coordinated a global data collection initiative across 22 countries to publish data on the impacts of COVID-19 among ASM communities (https://delvedatabase.org/covid-data). 2 State of the ASM Sector reports (2019, 2020) leveraging contributions from over 30 different institutions to demonstrate the sector's linkages to the SDGs and profile the positive examples of formalization taking place in the sector.",

Kiva Protocol offers an alternative approach to digital identity management that can provide real benefits to women.  An open-source authentication platform, Kiva Protocol enables individuals to store a version of their identity documents in a digital wallet that they control, providing them with a highly secure and portable digital record. The individual doesn’t have to rely on a physical credential, increasing agency and privacy over how and when to share her information. "

There was a need to move the emphasis from treatment to prevention. Project AEDES was then developed to improve public health response and address the challenge of getting real-time on the ground information on dengue.

QuML specification is designed for a wide range of use-cases by enabling configurable behaviour of questions and questions. It can support dynamic worksheets or tests, timed tests, limited attempts, multilingual questions, adaptive tests, rubric based assessments, polls, surveys, quizzes, etc.  This specification is used in Sunbird ED which is adopted by many organizations including the Ministry of Education, Government of India for DIKSHA. Given the unbundled nature of questions and machine independent representation, question object or question set object can be rendered within any user interface, forms, learning environment, polls, surveys, mobile applications, etc easily.

        "evidenceText": "Question Markup Language (QuML in short) is a specification for representation, storage, rendering and distribution of any type of “Questions” and “Question Sets”. Wherever a question can be used (assessments, practice, quizzes, surveys, feedbacks, polls, etc) across any domain, it can be represented within QuML as a structured markup. QuML enables interoperability between various systems by making them portable and markup driven.   This specification is based on IMS QTI Specification 2.2 with necessary extensions. QuML specification describes the information model for questions and question sets used in practice, assessments, surveys, quizzes, polls, and many other relevant use-cases. This specification describes a model for the representation of questions and question sets data and their corresponding results reports. Therefore, the specification enables the exchange of the question, question set and results data between authoring tools, question banks, test construction tools, learning systems and assessment delivery systems.  QuML specification is designed for a wide range of use-cases by enabling configurable behaviour of questions and questions. It can support dynamic worksheets or tests, timed tests, limited attempts, multilingual questions, adaptive tests, rubric based assessments, polls, surveys, quizzes, etc.  This specification is used in Sunbird ED which is adopted by many organizations including the Ministry of Education, Government of India for DIKSHA. Given the unbundled nature of questions and machine independent representation, question object or question set object can be rendered within any user interface, forms, learning environment, polls, surveys, mobile applications, etc easily.   QuML is an open-source (MIT license), configurable, extendable, modular, specification for learning and human development designed for massive scale implementations."

Electronic registres are trusted systems that enables consented actors (who are in the registry) to enroll and avail 3rd party services built on top of it using registry APIs. Sunbird RC can be used to build various registries of people, things, entries for across domains (hospital registry, teacher registry, vehicle registry, credential registry, etc) at country scale.   Adopters can rapidly build core electronic registries through configurable schemas and workflows. Software automatically created necessary APIs, workflows, and a default UX for all key stakeholders of the registry. In addition, adopters can use Sunbird RC to implement digital credentialing based on W3C Verifiable Credential specifications.",
